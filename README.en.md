## Requirements
* Python 3.5 (и выше)
* pip

## Installation
### Under console using pip

1. Install pip.
2. In the console, run the following command:
```bash
pip install yookassa-payout
```

### Under console using easy_install
1. Install easy_install.
2. In the console, run the following command:
```bash
easy_install --upgrade yookassa-payout
```

### Manually
1. In the console, run the following command:
```bash
wget https://github.com/yoomoney/yookassa-payout-sdk-python/archive/master.zip
tar zxf yookassa-payout-sdk-python-master.tar.gz
cd yookassa-payout-sdk-python-master
python setup.py install
```

## Getting a certificate for authenticating requests
To interact with YooMoney.The cashier must obtain a certificate. For this:
1. Create a private key and a certificate request (CSR).
2. Fill out the certificate application form.
3. Exchange data with YooMoney.

### Step 1. Creating a private key and CSR

#### Using the SDK method
1. Import classes to create CSR
```python
from yookassa_payout.domain.models.organization import Organization
from yookassa_payout.payout import Payout
```

2. Create an instance of the `Organization` class with data for creating the request. All data must be entered in Latin.
```python
org = Organization({
    "org_name": "YooMoney",              # Organization Name (Latin)
    "common_name": "/business/yoomoney", # Common Name, for example the name of your organization; must start with «/business/»
    "email": "cms@yoomoney.ru"           # Email
})
```
3. Create a CSR and a private key.
```python
# Specify the location where the files should be saved and the password for the private key (if necessary)
Payout.get_csr(org, './files/output', '12345')
```
As a result, the SDK will generate a private key, CSR, and a text file with an electronic signature (necessary for further steps).

#### Via the console
1. In the console, go to your project folder.
```bash
cd '<your project folder>'
```

2. Execute the command:
```
yookassa-payout -getcsr
```

3. Enter data for the certificate, following the instructions on the screen. The text must be entered in Latin letters.
As a result, the SDK will generate a private key, CSR, and a text file with an electronic signature (necessary for further steps).

### Step 2. Filling out the certificate application
[Download the application](https://yookassa.ru/docs/ssl_cert_form.doc) to the certificate, fill it out and print it out. Sign and seal the document. Scan.

For example, */business/predpriyatie*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Electronic signature of the certificate request  | The text view obtained in the previous step.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| The reason for the request                       | Possible options: <ul><li>*initial* — to get the first certificate;</li><li>*scheduled replacement* — to replace a certificate that has expired;</li><li>*replacement of a compromised* — to replace a previously issued certificate in the event of a security breach;</li><li>*adding a server* — to use the new certificate on additional servers or services.</li></ul> |
| Contact person (full name, phone number, e-mail) | Contact a specialist to contact you if you have any questions about the issued certificate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Step 3. Data exchange with YooMoney
Send the certificate request file (request.csr) and a scan of the request by email to your YooMoney Manager.Box office.
In response to the request, the Manager will send a file with the certificate within 2 business days. The certificate is valid for 1 year.
Place the received certificate on your server

## Start of work
1. Determine what types of payments you need and whether you want to check your balance.
2. Import required classes
```python
from yookassa_payout.domain.common.keychain import KeyChain
from yookassa_payout.configuration import Configuration
from yookassa_payout.payout import Payout
```

3. Import the classes you need to solve your problems.
4. Create an instance of the `KeyChain` class by passing the path to the public key, the path to the private key, and, if necessary, the password for the private key.
```python
keychain = KeyChain('publicCert.cer', 'privateCert.pem', 'password')
```

5. Create an instance of the `Client` class and pass the gateway ID from the [merchant profile](https://yookassa.ru/my) YooMoney and instance of the `KeyChain` class.
```python
Configuration.configure('000000', keychain)
```

6. Call the appropriate method. [More information about making payments](https://yookassa.ru/docs/payouts/api/using-api/basics?lang=en)
